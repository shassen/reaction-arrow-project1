# Reaction Arrow (RA)

Test your reaction time using your arrow keys. Click the down arrrow on the landing page to get started.

## Why Did I Choose Reaction Arrow You Ask??

As a new developer, I wanted to build something both challenging (for my skill level) and fun to play. RA doesn't just test your reactions, it can you help improve them with continued play (I should probably conduct tests before saying that, but who cares!).
