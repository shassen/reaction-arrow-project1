# Reaction Arrow (RA)

Test out your reaction time with Reaction Arrow!

## Why I Chose Reaction Arrow

As a new developer, I wanted to build something both challenging (for my skill level) and fun to play. RA doesn't just test your reactions, it improves them with continued play (I should probably conduct tests before saying that, but who cares!).

## Play

[Link to Reaction Arrow!](https://shassen.github.io/reaction-arrow-project1/)

1. Start by reading the instructions of RA (click the left arrow on the landing page).
2. When you're ready to play, click the down arrow on the landing page and the game will begin immediately.
3. When the time runs out, you will see your score.

### Game Rules:

    1. Up, right, down and left arrows will be presented to you in either white or red colors.
    2. Your objective, using the physical arrow keys on your keyboard, is to hit the RED arrow displayed on the screen.
    3. If you hit the correct arrow, you will see a red border flash around the arrow inidicating the correct arrow key (on your keyboard) was hit. This will trigger a new random arrow to display.
    4. Continue hitting the correct arrows for 20 seconds. 
    5. Your goal is to hit 50 or more correct arrows and less than 5 incorrect.
    6. If you hit 5 incorrect arrow keys, the game will end.
    7. Good luck!

## Features

In later builds, the game will play in a Modal window accessed by clicking the right arrow. For now, click the down arrow to navigate to the game page. Later builds will also include three difficulty levels allowing arrow combinations and calculated reaction times. I would also like to introduce a leaderboard and user profiles.
